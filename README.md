# Hi there!

My name is Mladen Krivaćević.

I'm a human being with an insatiable thirst for knowledge ! ... (dramatic pause for emphasis!)

Professionally, I navigate the world as a software engineer.

Regarding my educational journey, I once enrolled in the Faculty of Electrical Engineering. Although I was close to obtaining my BSc, I chose a different direction (a diplomatic way to say I dropped out)—sometimes I wonder if I should've taken that detour earlier (actually I know the answer to this one :smirk: ).

Outside of coding, I have a penchant for writing and occasionally dive into gaming, though that's become quite rare these days.

I wear many hats: a father, husband, an aspiring good son, brother, friend, a helpful and friendly neighbour, and a responsible citizen.

Now, let me tell you about my interests.

## These are the programming languages `I use/like the most at the moment`:

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=mladen&layout=compact)

## Here are the languages+technologies I'm `currently (re)learning`:

- Python (for data science, machine learning and web development)
- C (for systems programming, game development and embedded systems)
- C++ (for systems programming and game development))
- Docker (for containerization)
- SQL (for databases and data science)
- Electronics (I'm a beginner; playing around with Arduino using the Elegoo's "The Most Complete Starter Kit")

## Here are the languages+technologies I'm `planning to learn` in the future (at least some of them):

Most likely:

- Rust (for systems programming, game development and web development)
- Zig (for systems programming)
- Julia (for scientific computing)

Maybe:

- Mojo (for AI)
- Go (for systems programming)
- Haskell (for functional programming)

## CS areas I'm `interested` in\* (field titles taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)):

- Computational science, finance and engineering
  - Computational physics
  - Computational chemistry
  - Bioinformatics
  - Neuroinformatics
  - Medical informatics
- Image and sound processing
  - FFT algorithms
  - Image processing
  - Speech recognition
  - Data compression
  - Medical image computing
  - Speech synthesis
- Computer graphics and visualization
  - 2D computer graphics
  - Computer animation
  - Rendering
  - Mixed reality
  - Virtual reality
- Theory of computation
  - Quantum computing theory
- Data structures and algorithms
  - Algorithm design
  - Data structures
- Artificial Intelligence
  - Computational learning theory
  - Computer vision
  - Neural networks
  - Natural language processing
  - Computational game theory
  - Evolutionary computation
  - Autonomic computing
  - Pattern recognition
  - Robotics
  - Swarm intelligence

\*the list is not exhaustive :sweat_smile:

## Other areas I'm `especially interested` in (even though I'm a beginner in most of them):

- Mathematics (currently re-learning Linear Algebra - check out the [first 10 pages of my self-learning notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xnGnLHTG0R2OPtLmADXhx_KDQZT7r5ZS/view?usp=drive_link); soon I will be re-learning Calculus, Statistics, Probability and Logic)
- Physics (currently re-learning Classical Mechanics by reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics but also playing around with physics simulations)
- Chemistry + Biology (especially the intersection of the two, which is Biochemistry; currently not learning anything in these areas but I plan to in the future)
- Neuroscience (currently not learning anything in this area but I plan to in the future)
- Philosophy (currently reading a bit about Logic and Epistemology)
- Psychology (currently reading a bit about Cognitive Psychology)

- Education (I'm the founder of an NGO called Axiom, which is a non-profit organization that aims to help students improve their practical skills and knowledge in the fields of Natural and Technical Sciences, like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Engineering etc.).
