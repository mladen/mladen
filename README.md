# Hi there!

My name is Mladen Krivaćević.

I'm a human being with an insatiable thirst for knowledge ! ... (dramatic pause for emphasis!)

I am deeply passionate about learning and currently apply my skills as a software engineer. My academic background includes studying electrical engineering, a path I almost completed before choosing to explore different avenues. Outside of my professional life, I indulge in creative pursuits like writing and occasionally gaming, though these hobbies have become less frequent.

My personal life is filled with diverse roles: I'm a father, husband, an aspiring good son, brother, friend, a helpful and friendly neighbour, and a responsible citizen., each bringing its own set of joys and challenges.

When considering my career aspirations, I am drawn to fields that offer the opportunity to **contribute positively to the world**. I am particularly interested in areas such as biology, physics, mathematics, and biotechnology, where the potential for beneficial impact is immense. Conversely, I consciously avoid industries like gambling and pornography, which do not align with my personal and professional values.

Now, let me tell you about my interests.

## These are the programming languages `I use the most at the moment`:

- Physics (currently re-learning Classical Mechanics by reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics but also playing around with physics simulations)
- Chemistry + Biology (especially the intersection of the two, which is Biochemistry; currently not learning anything in these areas but I plan to in the future)
- Neuroscience (currently not learning anything in this area but I plan to in the future)
- Philosophy (currently reading a bit about Logic and Epistemology)
- Psychology (currently reading a bit about Cognitive Psychology)
