# Hi there!

My name is Mladen Krivaćević. I'm a software engineer who's always on the learning curve, a former student (dropout) of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, a budding writer, an occasional gamer, a father, a husband, a hopefully good son, a brother, a friend, a friendly neighbor, and a citizen. In short, I'm a full-stack human being. Now that I've taken a stab at humor and probably missed the mark, let's get just a smidge more serious—but not too much.

## These are the programming languages I use the most at the moment:

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=mladen&layout=compact)

## Here are the languages+technologies I'm currently (re)learning:

- Python
- C
- C++ (I'm a beginner)
- Docker
- SQL
- Electronics (I'm a beginner; playing around with Arduino using the Elegoo's The Most Complete Starter Kit)

## Here are the languages+technologies I'm planning to learn in the future:

- Go
- Rust

## CS areas I'm interested in:

- Data Science/Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence

## Other areas I'm **especially** interested in:

- Mathematics (I'm a beginner; currently re-learning Linear Algebra; soon I will be re-learning Calculus, Statistics, Probability and Logic)
- Physics (I'm a beginner; currently re-learning Classical Mechanics by reading the Feynman Lectures on Physics but also playing around with physics simulations)
- Chemistry + Biology (I'm a beginner; especially the intersection of the two, which is Biochemistry; currently not learning anything in these areas but I plan to in the future)
- Neuroscience (I'm a beginner; currently not learning anything in this area but I plan to in the future)
- Philosophy (I'm a beginner; currently reading about Logic and Epistemology)
- Psychology (I'm a beginner; currently reading a bit about Cognitive Psychology)
